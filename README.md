<h1>Hi, I'm Chris! <br/><a href="https://github.com/chris-henry-holland">Programmer</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-holland-0377a819/">Aspiring Data Scientist</a>
<h2>🔭 About me </h2>
I am a qualified UK medical doctor looking to transition into a coding and data science career. My hope is to combine my experience and interest in medicine and programming to eventually work as a software developer or data scientist in healthcare. My short term priority is to gain experience in software development and/or data science as part of a team, given that my experience in this domain has primarily been in individual projects.

My main language is Python, and have experience with the numpy, scipy and pytorch packages. I also have more limited experience with Perl and C++, as well more specialist packages including SQL and R.

<h2>🌱 Education</h2>

- MBBS, King's College London (qualified 2017)
- BA/MSci Natural Sciences (Astrophysics), University of Cambridge, First class honors (graduated 2011)
- BSc Mathematics, Open University, First class honors (completed 2017)
<h2>👨‍💻 Software Development Projects:</h2>
<h3> Python </h3>
<h4>Smaller Projects</h4>

- <b>[Algorithms and Data Structures]</b>   
  - [Algorithms]- including graph algorithms, prime sieves and string searching algorithms   
- <b>Project Euler Solutions</b>
